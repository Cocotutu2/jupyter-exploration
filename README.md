L0 ITAI 1378 Colab and other Tools Practice Run 
(Part 1: Setting Up and Exploring GitHub): 
This repository contains files and notes from a lab session focused on exploring Jupyter notebooks (Google Colab) and Github. 
The purpose of this lab is to familiarize with creating, running, and managing Jupyter notebooks (Goole Colab) as part of a practical introduction to data science workflows. 
Throughout the session, I will learn how to set up repositories, pull requests, write and execute code cells, and document work in a reproducible way.

(Part 2: Working with Jupyter Notebooks):
This part of the lab session guides through accessing and working with Jupyter Notebooks using online environments like Google Colab, or optionally installing Jupyter Notebook locall. 
I will learn to launch a notebook, navigate its interface, create their first notebook with Markdown and code cells, and execute code interactively. 
The session also covers saving, downloading, and sharing notebooks, including uploading them to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. 
This introductory lab is designed for beginners to get hands-on experience with Jupyter notebooks (Google Colab). 
This workflow allow reproducible, shareable data science projects and collaborative coding in a user-friendly, interactive environment.
